 think i should indicate why i am here in birmingham, since you have 
been influenced by the view which argues against "outsiders coming in." i
 have the honor of serving as president of the southern christian 
leadership conference, an organization operating in every southern 
state, with headquarters in atlanta, georgia. we have some eighty five 
affiliated organizations across the south, and one of them is the 
alabama christian movement for human rights. frequently we share staff, 
educational and financial resources with our affiliates. several months 
ago the affiliate here in birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in
 a nonviolent direct action program if such were deemed necessary. we 
readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. so
 i, along with several members of my staff, am here because i was 
invited here. i am here because i have organizational ties here.

but more basically, i am in birmingham because injustice is here. just 
as the prophets of the eighth century b.c. left their villages and 
carried their "thus saith the lord" far beyond the boundaries of their 
home towns, and just as the apostle paul left his village of tarsus and 
carried the gospel of jesus christ to the far corners of the greco roman
 world, so am i compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own 
home town. like paul, i must constantly respond to the macedonian call 
for aid.

moreover, i am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and 
states. i cannot sit idly by in atlanta and not be concerned about what 
happens in birmingham. injustice anywhere is a threat to justice 
everywhere. we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied 
in a single garment of destiny. whatever affects one directly, affects 
all indirectly. never again can we afford to live with the narrow, 
provincial "outside agitator" idea. anyone who lives inside the united 
states can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.

you deplore the demonstrations taking place in birmingham. but your 
statement, i am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the
 conditions that brought about the demonstrations. i am sure that none 
of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social 
analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with 
underlying causes. it is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking 
place in birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's 
white power structure left the negro community with no alternative.

in any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the
 facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self 
purification; and direct action. we have gone through all these steps in
 birmingham. there can be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice 
engulfs this community. birmingham is probably the most thoroughly 
segregated city in the united states. its ugly record of brutality is 
widely known. negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the 
courts. there have been more unsolved bombings of negro homes and 
churches in birmingham than in any other city in the nation. these are 
the hard, brutal facts of the case. on the basis of these conditions, 
negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. but the latter 
consistently refused to engage in good faith negotiation.

then, last september, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of 
birmingham's economic community. in the course of the negotiations, 
certain promises were made by the merchants--for example, to remove the 
stores' humiliating racial signs. on the basis of these promises, the 
reverend fred shuttlesworth and the leaders of the alabama christian 
movement for human rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations. 
as the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of
 a broken promise. a few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others 
remained. as in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, 
and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us. we had no 
alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would 
present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the 
conscience of the local and the national community. mindful of the 
difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self 
purification. we began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we 
repeatedly asked ourselves: "are you able to accept blows without 
retaliating?" "are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?" we decided to
 schedule our direct action program for the easter season, realizing 
that except for christmas, this is the main shopping period of the year.
 knowing that a strong economic-withdrawal program would be the by 
product of direct action, we felt that this would be the best time to 
bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change.

then it occurred to us that birmingham's mayoral election was coming up 
in march, and we speedily decided to postpone action until after 
election day. when we discovered that the commissioner of public safety,
 eugene "bull" connor, had piled up enough votes to be in the run off, 
we decided again to postpone action until the day after the run off so 
that the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues. like many
 others, we waited to see mr. connor defeated, and to this end we 
endured postponement after postponement. having aided in this community 
need, we felt that our direct action program could be delayed no longer.

you may well ask: "why direct action? why sit ins, marches and so forth?
 isn't negotiation a better path?" you are quite right in calling for 
negotiation. indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. 
nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a
 tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is 
forced to confront the issue. it seeks so to dramatize the issue that it
 can no longer be ignored. my citing the creation of tension as part of 
the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. but i 
must confess that i am not afraid of the word "tension." i have 
earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, 
nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. just as socrates felt 
that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that 
individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the 
unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must 
we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in
 society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and 
racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. the 
purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis 
packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. i therefore
 concur with you in your call for negotiation. too long has our beloved 
southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue 
rather than dialogue.

one of the basic points in your statement is that the action that i and 
my associates have taken in birmingham is untimely. some have asked: 
"why didn't you give the new city administration time to act?" the only 
answer that i can give to this query is that the new birmingham 
administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before
 it will act. we are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of 
albert boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to birmingham. while 
mr. boutwell is a much more gentle person than mr. connor, they are both
 segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. i have 
hope that mr. boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of 
massive resistance to desegregation. but he will not see this without 
pressure from devotees of civil rights. my friends, i must say to you 
that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined 
legal and nonviolent pressure. lamentably, it is an historical fact that
 privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. 
individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust
 posture; but, as reinhold niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be 
more immoral than individuals.

we know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily 
given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. frankly, i
 have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was "well timed" in
 the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of 
segregation. for years now i have heard the word "wait!" it rings in the
 ear of every negro with piercing familiarity. this "wait" has almost 
always meant "never." we must come to see, with one of our distinguished
 jurists, that "justice too long delayed is justice denied."

we have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and god 
given rights. the nations of asia and africa are moving with jetlike 
speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse
 and buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. 
perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of 
segregation to say, "wait." but when you have seen vicious mobs lynch 
your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at 
whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill
 your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your
 twenty million negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty
 in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue
 twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six 
year old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has
 just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her 
eyes when she is told that funtown is closed to colored children, and 
see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental
 sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an 
unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an 
answer for a five year old son who is asking: "daddy, why do white 
people treat colored people so mean?"; when you take a cross county 
drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the 
uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept 
you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading
 "white" and "colored"; when your first name becomes "nigger," your 
middle name becomes "boy" (however old you are) and your last name 
becomes "john," and your wife and mother are never given the respected 
title "mrs."; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the 
fact that you are a negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never 
quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and 
outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of
 "nobodiness"--then you will understand why we find it difficult to 
wait. there comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men 
are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. i hope, 
sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience. you 
express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. this
 is certainly a legitimate concern. since we so diligently urge people 
to obey the supreme court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in 
the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for 
us consciously to break laws. one may well ask: "how can you advocate 
breaking some laws and obeying others?" the answer lies in the fact that
 there are two types of laws: just and unjust. i would be the first to 
advocate obeying just laws. one has not only a legal but a moral 
responsibility to obey just laws. conversely, one has a moral 
responsibility to disobey unjust laws. i would agree with st. augustine 
that "an unjust law is no law at all."

now, what is the difference between the two? how does one determine 
whether a law is just or unjust? a just law is a man made code that 
squares with the moral law or the law of god. an unjust law is a code 
that is out of harmony with the moral law. to put it in the terms of st.
 thomas aquinas: an unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in 
eternal law and natural law. any law that uplifts human personality is 
just. any law that degrades human personality is unjust. all segregation
 statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages 
the personality. it gives the segregator a false sense of superiority 
and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. segregation, to use the
 terminology of the jewish philosopher martin buber, substitutes an "i 
it" relationship for an "i thou" relationship and ends up relegating 
persons to the status of things. hence segregation is not only 
politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally 
wrong and sinful. paul tillich has said that sin is separation. is not 
segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, his 
awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? thus it is that i can urge 
men to obey the 1954 decision of the supreme court, for it is morally 
right; and i can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they 
are morally wrong.

let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. an 
unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a 
minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. this is 
difference made legal. by the same token, a just law is a code that a 
majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow 
itself. this is sameness made legal. let me give another explanation. a 
law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of 
being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the 
law. who can say that the legislature of alabama which set up that 
state's segregation laws was democratically elected? throughout alabama 
all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent negroes from becoming 
registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though 
negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single negro is 
registered. can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered 
democratically structured?

sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. for 
instance, i have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit.
 now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a 
permit for a parade. but such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is 
used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the first-amendment 
privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.

i hope you are able to see the distinction i am trying to point out. in 
no sense do i advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid 
segregationist. that would lead to anarchy. one who breaks an unjust law
 must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the 
penalty. i submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience 
tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of 
imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its
 injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.

of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. 
it was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of shadrach, meshach and 
abednego to obey the laws of nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher
 moral law was at stake. it was practiced superbly by the early 
christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating 
pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the
 roman empire. to a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because 
socrates practiced civil disobedience. in our own nation, the boston tea
 party represented a massive act of civil disobedience.

we should never forget that everything adolf hitler did in germany was 
"legal" and everything the hungarian freedom fighters did in hungary was
 "illegal." it was "illegal" to aid and comfort a jew in hitler's 
germany. even so, i am sure that, had i lived in germany at the time, i 
would have aided and comforted my jewish brothers. if today i lived in a
 communist country where certain principles dear to the christian faith 
are suppressed, i would openly advocate disobeying that country's 
antireligious laws.

i must make two honest confessions to you, my christian and jewish 
brothers. first, i must confess that over the past few years i have been
 gravely disappointed with the white moderate. i have almost reached the
 regrettable conclusion that the negro's great stumbling block in his 
stride toward freedom is not the white citizen's counciler or the ku 
klux klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" 
than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of 
tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who 
constantly says: "i agree with you in the goal you seek, but i cannot 
agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically 
believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives 
by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the negro to 
wait for a "more convenient season." shallow understanding from people 
of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from 
people of ill will. lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than 
outright rejection.

i had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order 
exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in
 this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the
 flow of social progress. i had hoped that the white moderate would 
understand that the present tension in the south is a necessary phase of
 the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the negro 
passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive 
peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human 
personality. actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not
 the creators of tension. we merely bring to the surface the hidden 
tension that is already alive. we bring it out in the open, where it can
 be seen and dealt with. like a boil that can never be cured so long as 
it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural
 medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the 
tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the 
air of national opinion before it can be cured.

in your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, 
must be condemned because they precipitate violence. but is this a 
logical assertion? isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his 
possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? isn't this 
like condemning socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and 
his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided 
populace in which they made him drink hemlock? isn't this like 
condemning jesus because his unique god consciousness and never ceasing 
devotion to god's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? we must
 come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it 
is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic 
constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. 
society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. i had also hoped 
that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in 
relation to the struggle for freedom. i have just received a letter from
 a white brother in texas. he writes: "all christians know that the 
colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible 
that you are in too great a religious hurry. it has taken christianity 
almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. the teachings of 
christ take time to come to earth." such an attitude stems from a tragic
 misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there 
is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all 
ills. actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either 
destructively or constructively. more and more i feel that the people of
 ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of 
good will. we will have to repent in this generation not merely for the 
hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling 
silence of the good people. human progress never rolls in on wheels of 
inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to 
be co workers with god, and without this hard work, time itself becomes 
an ally of the forces of social stagnation. we must use time creatively,
 in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. now is the 
time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending 
national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. now is the time to 
lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the 
solid rock of human dignity.

you speak of our activity in birmingham as extreme. at first i was 
rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent 
efforts as those of an extremist. i began thinking about the fact that i
 stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the negro community. one 
is a force of complacency, made up in part of negroes who, as a result 
of long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect and a sense 
of "somebodiness" that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of
 a few middle-class negroes who, because of a degree of academic and 
economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation, 
have become insensitive to the problems of the masses. the other force 
is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to 
advocating violence. it is expressed in the various black nationalist 
groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and best 
known being elijah muhammad's muslim movement. nourished by the negro's 
frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this 
movement is made up of people who have lost faith in america, who have 
absolutely repudiated christianity, and who have concluded that the 
white man is an incorrigible "devil."

i have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need 
emulate neither the "do nothingism" of the complacent nor the hatred and
 despair of the black nationalist. for there is the more excellent way 
of love and nonviolent protest. i am grateful to god that, through the 
influence of the negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral
 part of our struggle. if this philosophy had not emerged, by now many 
streets of the south would, i am convinced, be flowing with blood. and i
 am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as "rabble 
rousers" and "outside agitators" those of us who employ nonviolent 
direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, 
millions of negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace 
and security in black nationalist ideologies--a development that would 
inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.

oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. the yearning for 
freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to 
the american negro. something within has reminded him of his birthright 
of freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be 
gained. consciously or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the 
zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of africa and his brown and 
yellow brothers of asia, south america and the caribbean, the united 
states negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised
 land of racial justice. if one recognizes this vital urge that has 
engulfed the negro community, one should readily understand why public 
demonstrations are taking place. the negro has many pent up resentments 
and latent frustrations, and he must release them. so let him march; let
 him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom 
rides -and try to understand why he must do so. if his repressed 
emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression 
through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history. so i have 
not said to my people: "get rid of your discontent." rather, i have 
tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled 
into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. and now this 
approach is being termed extremist. but though i was initially 
disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as i continued to 
think about the matter i gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from
 the label. was not jesus an extremist for love: "love your enemies, 
bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for 
them which despitefully use you, and persecute you." was not amos an 
extremist for justice: "let justice roll down like waters and 
righteousness like an ever flowing stream." was not paul an extremist 
for the christian gospel: "i bear in my body the marks of the lord 
jesus." was not martin luther an extremist: "here i stand; i cannot do 
otherwise, so help me god." and john bunyan: "i will stay in jail to the
 end of my days before i make a butchery of my conscience." and abraham 
lincoln: "this nation cannot survive half slave and half free." and 
thomas jefferson: "we hold these truths to be self evident, that all men
 are created equal . . ." so the question is not whether we will be 
extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. will we be 
extremists for hate or for love? will we be extremists for the 
preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice? in that 
dramatic scene on calvary's hill three men were crucified. we must never
 forget that all three were crucified for the same crime--the crime of 
extremism. two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their
 environment. the other, jesus christ, was an extremist for love, truth 
and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. perhaps the south,
 the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.

i had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. perhaps i was 
too optimistic; perhaps i expected too much. i suppose i should have 
realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep 
groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer 
have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, 
persistent and determined action. i am thankful, however, that some of 
our white brothers in the south have grasped the meaning of this social 
revolution and committed themselves to it. they are still all too few in
 quantity, but they are big in quality. some -such as ralph mcgill, 
lillian smith, harry golden, james mcbride dabbs, ann braden and sarah 
patton boyle--have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic 
terms. others have marched with us down nameless streets of the south. 
they have languished in filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the 
abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as "dirty nigger-lovers."
 unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have 
recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful 
"action" antidotes to combat the disease of segregation. let me take 
note of my other major disappointment. i have been so greatly 
disappointed with the white church and its leadership. of course, there 
are some notable exceptions. i am not unmindful of the fact that each of
 you has taken some significant stands on this issue. i commend you, 
reverend stallings, for your christian stand on this past sunday, in 
welcoming negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. i 
commend the catholic leaders of this state for integrating spring hill 
college several years ago.

but despite these notable exceptions, i must honestly reiterate that i 
have been disappointed with the church. i do not say this as one of 
those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the 
church. i say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; 
who was nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its spiritual 
blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life 
shall lengthen.

when i was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in
 montgomery, alabama, a few years ago, i felt we would be supported by 
the white church. i felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of
 the south would be among our strongest allies. instead, some have been 
outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and 
misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious
 than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing 
security of stained glass windows.

in spite of my shattered dreams, i came to birmingham with the hope that
 the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice 
of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the channel 
through which our just grievances could reach the power structure. i had
 hoped that each of you would understand. but again i have been 
disappointed.

i have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their 
worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the 
law, but i have longed to hear white ministers declare: "follow this 
decree because integration is morally right and because the negro is 
your brother." in the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the 
negro, i have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth 
pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. in the midst of a 
mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, i 
have heard many ministers say: "those are social issues, with which the 
gospel has no real concern." and i have watched many churches commit 
themselves to a completely other worldly religion which makes a strange,
 un-biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and 
the secular.

i have traveled the length and breadth of alabama, mississippi and all 
the other southern states. on sweltering summer days and crisp autumn 
mornings i have looked at the south's beautiful churches with their 
lofty spires pointing heavenward. i have beheld the impressive outlines 
of her massive religious education buildings. over and over i have found
 myself asking: "what kind of people worship here? who is their god? 
where were their voices when the lips of governor barnett dripped with 
words of interposition and nullification? where were they when governor 
wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? where were their 
voices of support when bruised and weary negro men and women decided to 
rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of 
creative protest?"

yes, these questions are still in my mind. in deep disappointment i have
 wept over the laxity of the church. but be assured that my tears have 
been tears of love. there can be no deep disappointment where there is 
not deep love. yes, i love the church. how could i do otherwise? i am in
 the rather unique position of being the son, the grandson and the great
 grandson of preachers. yes, i see the church as the body of christ. 
but, oh! how we have blemished and scarred that body through social 
neglect and through fear of being nonconformists.

there was a time when the church was very powerful--in the time when the
 early christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what 
they believed. in those days the church was not merely a thermometer 
that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was a 
thermostat that transformed the mores of society. whenever the early 
christians entered a town, the people in power became disturbed and 
immediately sought to convict the christians for being "disturbers of 
the peace" and "outside agitators."' but the christians pressed on, in 
the conviction that they were "a colony of heaven," called to obey god 
rather than man. small in number, they were big in commitment. they were
 too god-intoxicated to be "astronomically intimidated." by their effort
 and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide 
and gladiatorial contests. things are different now. so often the 
contemporary church is a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain 
sound. so often it is an archdefender of the status quo. far from being 
disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the 
average community is consoled by the church's silent--and often even 
vocal--sanction of things as they are.

but the judgment of god is upon the church as never before. if today's 
church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it
 will lose its authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be 
dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth
 century. every day i meet young people whose disappointment with the 
church has turned into outright disgust.

perhaps i have once again been too optimistic. is organized religion too
 inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world? 
perhaps i must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the church 
within the church, as the true ekklesia and the hope of the world. but 
again i am thankful to god that some noble souls from the ranks of 
organized religion have broken loose from the paralyzing chains of 
conformity and joined us as active partners in the struggle for freedom.
 they have left their secure congregations and walked the streets of 
albany, georgia, with us. they have gone down the highways of the south 
on tortuous rides for freedom. yes, they have gone to jail with us. some
 have been dismissed from their churches, have lost the support of their
 bishops and fellow ministers. but they have acted in the faith that 
right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. their witness has been 
the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the gospel in 
these troubled times. they have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark
 mountain of disappointment. i hope the church as a whole will meet the 
challenge of this decisive hour. but even if the church does not come to
 the aid of justice, i have no despair about the future. i have no fear 
about the outcome of our struggle in birmingham, even if our motives are
 at present misunderstood. we will reach the goal of freedom in 
birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of america is 
freedom. abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up 
with america's destiny. before the pilgrims landed at plymouth, we were 
here. before the pen of jefferson etched the majestic words of the 
declaration of independence across the pages of history, we were here. 
for more than two centuries our forebears labored in this country 
without wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their 
masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation -and 
yet out of a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and develop. 
if the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the 
opposition we now face will surely fail. we will win our freedom because
 the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of god are 
embodied in our echoing demands. before closing i feel impelled to 
mention one other point in your statement that has troubled me 
profoundly. you warmly commended the birmingham police force for keeping
 "order" and "preventing violence." i doubt that you would have so 
warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their
 teeth into unarmed, nonviolent negroes. i doubt that you would so 
quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and 
inhumane treatment of negroes here in the city jail; if you were to 
watch them push and curse old negro women and young negro girls; if you 
were to see them slap and kick old negro men and young boys; if you were
 to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give us food 
because we wanted to sing our grace together. i cannot join you in your 
praise of the birmingham police department.

it is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in 
handling the demonstrators. in this sense they have conducted themselves
 rather "nonviolently" in public. but for what purpose? to preserve the 
evil system of segregation. over the past few years i have consistently 
preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure 
as the ends we seek. i have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use 
immoral means to attain moral ends. but now i must affirm that it is 
just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve 
immoral ends. perhaps mr. connor and his policemen have been rather 
nonviolent in public, as was chief pritchett in albany, georgia, but 
they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral 
end of racial injustice. as t. s. eliot has said: "the last temptation 
is the greatest treason: to do the right deed for the wrong reason."

i wish you had commended the negro sit inners and demonstrators of 
birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and 
their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation. one day the 
south will recognize its real heroes. they will be the james merediths, 
with the noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and 
hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the 
life of the pioneer. they will be old, oppressed, battered negro women, 
symbolized in a seventy two year old woman in montgomery, alabama, who 
rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride 
segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one
 who inquired about her weariness: "my feets is tired, but my soul is at
 rest." they will be the young high school and college students, the 
young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously 
and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to 
jail for conscience' sake. one day the south will know that when these 
disinherited children of god sat down at lunch counters, they were in 
reality standing up for what is best in the american dream and for the 
most sacred values in our judaeo christian heritage, thereby bringing 
our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by
 the founding fathers in their formulation of the constitution and the 
declaration of independence.

never before have i written so long a letter. i'm afraid it is much too 
long to take your precious time. i can assure you that it would have 
been much shorter if i had been writing from a comfortable desk, but 
what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other than 
write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers?

if i have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and 
indicates an unreasonable impatience, i beg you to forgive me. if i have
 said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a 
patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, i 
beg god to forgive me.

i hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. i also hope that 
circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not
 as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman
 and a christian brother. let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial
 prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will
 be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too 
distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine 
over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.<br><br>total characters: 39646<br><p>a: 2796 occurence(s) | rank: 3 | desired rank: 3</p><br><p>b: 478 occurence(s) | rank: 20 | desired rank: 19</p><br><p>c: 998 occurence(s) | rank: 13 | desired rank: 12</p><br><p>d: 1163 occurence(s) | rank: 11 | desired rank: 10</p><br><p>e: 4000 occurence(s) | rank: 1 | desired rank: 1</p><br><p>f: 701 occurence(s) | rank: 15 | desired rank: 16</p><br><p>g: 695 occurence(s) | rank: 16 | desired rank: 17</p><br><p>h: 1691 occurence(s) | rank: 9 | desired rank: 8</p><br><p>i: 2487 occurence(s) | rank: 5 | desired rank: 5</p><br><p>j: 104 occurence(s) | rank: 25 | desired rank: 23</p><br><p>k: 124 occurence(s) | rank: 24 | desired rank: 22</p><br><p>l: 1216 occurence(s) | rank: 10 | desired rank: 11</p><br><p>m: 836 occurence(s) | rank: 14 | desired rank: 14</p><br><p>n: 2270 occurence(s) | rank: 6 | desired rank: 6</p><br><p>o: 2495 occurence(s) | rank: 4 | desired rank: 4</p><br><p>p: 570 occurence(s) | rank: 19 | desired rank: 20</p><br><p>q: 25 occurence(s) | rank: 28 | desired rank: 25</p><br><p>r: 1880 occurence(s) | rank: 8 | desired rank: 9</p><br><p>s: 2063 occurence(s) | rank: 7 | desired rank: 7</p><br><p>t: 3055 occurence(s) | rank: 2 | desired rank: 2</p><br><p>u: 1008 occurence(s) | rank: 12 | desired rank: 13</p><br><p>v: 377 occurence(s) | rank: 21 | desired rank: 21</p><br><p>w: 618 occurence(s) | rank: 17 | desired rank: 15</p><br><p>x: 58 occurence(s) | rank: 26 | desired rank: 24</p><br><p>y: 572 occurence(s) | rank: 18 | desired rank: 18</p><br><p>z: 25 occurence(s) | rank: 29 | desired rank: 26</p><br><p> : 0 occurence(s) | rank: 0 | desired rank: 0</p><br><p>.: 299 occurence(s) | rank: 22 | desired rank: 0</p><br><p>,: 266 occurence(s) | rank: 23 | desired rank: 0</p><br><p>?: 28 occurence(s) | rank: 27 | desired rank: 0</p><br><p>!: 2 occurence(s) | rank: 30 | desired rank: 0</p><br>
